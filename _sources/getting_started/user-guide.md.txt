# User Guide

Welcome to the ORAS Operator user guide! If you come here, we are assuming you have a cluster
with the ORAS Operator installed and are interested to submit your own [custom resource](custom-resource-definition.md) to create an OrasCache, 
or that someone has already done it for you. If you are a developer wanting to work on new functionality or features, see our [Developer Guides](../development/index.md) instead.

## Usage

### Overview

An OrasCache deploys an OCI Registry as Storage (ORAS) registry. If you are familiar with Docker and container registries, the idea is similar.
Instead of pushing and pulling layers that are assembled into Docker images, we can instead push and pull artifacts. Use cases for
the ORAS operator might include (but are not limited to):

- I am running experiments that save a ton of small files and I want a place to save them to get at the end.
- I am running a workflow that starts with data from a large storage, and I want to persist intermediate workflow files (but not clutter up the original source)
- I am saving data and I don't feel like messing with storage or a local host mount (yuck)

Arguably if this works, it should also work to push to an actual (non cluster-based) OCI registry. This would be for use cases when you want whatever you are doing to be persisted longer (and maybe shared with collaborators or something like that). This case would be non-ephemeral and require credentials, and arguably you could still use oras to move the artifact between the local temporary service and the final registry.

### Install

#### Quick Install

This works best for production Kubernetes clusters, and you can start with creating a Kind cluster:

```bash
kind create cluster
```

and then downloading the latest ORAS Operator yaml config, and applying it.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.13.1/cert-manager.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/converged-computing/oras-operator/main/examples/dist/oras-operator.yaml
```

Note that from the repository, this config is generated with:

```bash
$ make build-config
```

and then saved to the main branch where you retrieve it from.

#### Helm Install

We optionally provide an install with helm, which you can do either from the charts in the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/converged-computing/oras-operator
$ cd oras-operator
$ helm install ./chart
```

Or directly from GitHub packages (an OCI registry):

```
# helm prior to v3.8.0
$ export HELM_EXPERIMENTAL_OCI=1
$ helm pull oci://ghcr.io/converged-computing/oras-operator-helm/chart
```
```console
Pulled: ghcr.io/converged-computing/oras-operator-helm/chart:0.1.0
```

And install!

```bash
$ helm install chart-0.1.0.tgz
```
```console
NAME: oras-operator

```

### Annotations

The Oras Operator works by way of deploying an ORAS (OCI Registry as Storage) Registry to a namespace, and then the workflow tool can add annotations to pods or jobs to control how artifacts are cached (retrieved and saved for subsequent steps). 
In that most workflow tools understand inputs and outputs and the DAG, this should be feasible to do. Here are example annotations for pods and jobs, first a pod:


```yaml
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: hello-world-1
  annotations:
     # the name of the cache for the workflow, the name from oras.yaml
     oras.converged-computing.github.io/oras-cache: orascache-sample

     # This is how to ask for more than one input to be extracted to the same place
     oras.converged-computing.github.io/input-uri: dinosaur/hello-world:input
     oras.converged-computing.github.io/output-uri: dinosaur/hello-world:output

     # Print all final settings in the log
     oras.converged-computing.github.io/debug: "true"
```

The above is very simplistic, and will expect to prepare the workspace (the working directory or "input-path" annotation of the application container) with an extraction of
the "input-uri" annotation. Here is an example with a job:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: breakfast
  annotations:
    # the name of the cache for the workflow, the name from oras.yaml
    oras.converged-computing.github.io/oras-cache: orascache-sample

    # The URI for the workflow artifact output. Tag is important here - a steo
    # in a dag would need to also include input-uri and push/pull based on dag
    oras.converged-computing.github.io/output-uri: dinosaur/hello-world:pancakes

    # Dummy example to use hello-world.txt touched in working directory
    oras.converged-computing.github.io/output-path: pancakes.txt

    # Pipe output to this path
    oras.converged-computing.github.io/output-pipe: pancakes.txt

    # Print all final settings in the log
    oras.converged-computing.github.io/debug: "true"

spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: breakfast
        image: perl:5.34.0
        command: [echo, blueberry]
      restartPolicy: Never
```

Note that the annotation above is on the level of the job, and will be carried forward to edit the JobTemplateSpec (without adding the annotations again).
We do this to ensure that the operator isn't triggered twice. E.g., if you were to put the annotations on the Pod template spec, it might trigger adding the sidecar
once, first for the job, and then for the underlying pod(s) it creates. Annotations and their defaults include:

| Name | Description | Required | List | Default |
|------|-------------|----------|------|---------|
| input-path | The path in the container that any requested archive is expected to be extracted to | false | false | the working directory of the application container |
| output-path | The output path in the container to save files | false | false |the working directory of the application container |
| output-pipe | Pipe the output of your command into this file | false | false |unset |
| input-uri | The input unique resource identifier for the registry step, including repository, name, and tag | false | true |NA will be used if not defined, meaning the step has no inputs |
| output-uri | The output unique resource identifier for the registry step, including repository, name, and tag | false | false |NA will be used if not defined, meaning the step has no outputs |
| oras-cache | The name of the sidecar orchestrator | false | false | oras |
| oras-container | The container with oras to run for the service | false | false | ghcr.io/oras-project/oras:v1.1.0 |
| container | The name of the launcher container | false | false | assumes the first container found requires the launcher |
| entrypoint | The https address of the application entrypoint to wget | false | false | [entrypoint.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/converged-computing/oras-operator/main/hack/entrypoint.sh) |
| oras-entrypoint | The https address of the oras cache sidecar entrypoint to wget | false | false | [oras-entrypoint.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/converged-computing/oras-operator/main/hack/oras-entrypoint.sh) |
| debug | Print all discovered settings in the operator log | false | false | "false" |

There should not be a need to change the oras-cache (sidecar container) unless for some reason you have another container in the pod also called oras. It is exposed for this rare case.

Note that when List is true, this means the annotation can be provided as a list, and more than one value can be added with the pattern `<prefix>/<field>_<count>`. Currently the only supported list field is `input-uri`, anticipating that multiple parent steps might feed into one child step.

```yaml
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: hello-world-3
  annotations:
     # the name of the cache for the workflow, the name from oras.yaml
     oras.converged-computing.github.io/oras-cache: orascache-sample

     # This is how to ask for more than one input to be extracted to the same place
     oras.converged-computing.github.io/input-uri_1: dinosaur/hello-world:one
     oras.converged-computing.github.io/input-uri_2: dinosaur/hello-world:two

     # Print all final settings in the log
     oras.converged-computing.github.io/debug: "true"
```

Currently not supported (but will be soon / if needed):

- More than one launcher container in a pod

Note that while the above can be set manually, the expectation is that a workflow tool will do it. For each of the `input-path` and `output-path` we recommend providing
specific files or directories, and note that if one is not set we use the working directory, which (if this is the root of the container) will result in an error.
In the case that no output-path is specified, we assume there is nothing to copy (and you should not set output-uri).

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows). Create the cluster:

```bash
kind create cluster
```

Install the operator and this include [cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager) for webhook certificates:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.13.1/cert-manager.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/converged-computing/oras-operator/main/examples/dist/oras-operator.yaml

# same as...
make test-deploy
kubectl apply -f examples/dist/oras-operator-dev.yaml
```

See logs:

```bash
kubectl logs -n oras-operator-system oras-operator-controller-manager-ff66845dd-5299h 
```

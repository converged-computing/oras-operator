# About the ORAS Operator

We have vision for a future where the cloud and high performance computing communities
are working together, and learning from one another to build new technologies that combine
the best of both worlds. This work started with the [Flux Operator](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-operator)
and then the [Metrics Operator](https://github.com/converged-computing/metrics-operator) and continues
here with the ORAS Operator. With this project, we aim to make it easy to cache artifacts between
workflow steps, or for one-off experiments. This project is early in development, so we hope
you come back later to check it out. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please [let us know](https://github.com/converged-computing/oras-operator/issues)
